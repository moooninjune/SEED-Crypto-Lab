# SQL Injection Attack Lab

SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits the vulnerabilities in the interface between web applications and database servers.

Web applications often take user *inputs* to construct SQL queries for retrieving or storing data in a database. If these queries are not properly constructed, SQL injection vulnerabilities can arise.

![SQL Injection Attack](https://github.com/moooninjune/SEED-labs/blob/0b33ad65947b0754b4916b8eff9f10c15190fc80/images/lab8-SQL-injection-attack.png)

## Lab Environment Setup:

1. Map the web application's hostname `www.seed-server.com` to the containerâ€™s IP address `10.9.0.5`, by adding this entry to the `/etc/hosts` file.

    ```bash
    sudo gedit /etc/hosts

    #add the following entry
    10.9.0.5    www.seed-server.com
    ```

2. To set up this web application, there are two containers, one for hosting the *web application*, and the other for hosting *the database* for the web application.
    - Use the docker-compose.yml file to set up the lab environment.
    ```bash
    $ dcbuild # Alias for: docker-compose build
    $ dcup  # Alias for: docker-compose up
    ```

    - All the containers will be running in the background.
    ```bash
    # to find out the ID of the container
    # Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}} {{.Names}}"
    $ dockps

    # to start a shell on that container
    # Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
    $ docksh <id>
    ```
    - Example:
    ```bash
    #in one terminal:

    $ dockps
    6f9ac28727e7  mysql-10.9.0.6
    501c8b535e7a  www-10.9.0.5

    $ docksh 6f # SQL database container

    #in another terminal:

    $ docksh 50 # web application container
    ```

## Task 1: Get Familiar with SQL Statements:

The data used by our web application is stored in a MySQL database, which is **hosted on our MySQL container**. We have created a database called `sqllab_users`, which contains a table called `credential`. The table stores the personal information (e.g. eid, password, salary, ssn, etc.) of every employee.

Inside the MySQL container:
```
# mysql -u root -pdees

mysql> use sqllab_users;
Database changed

mysql> show tables;
+------------------------+
| Tables_in_sqllab_users |
+------------------------+
| credential             |
+------------------------+
```

Use a SQL command to print all the profile information of the employee *Alice*:
```sql
select * from credential where Name='Alice';
```
