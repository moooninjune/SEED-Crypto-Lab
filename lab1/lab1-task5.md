## Task 5: Error Propagation â€“ Corrupted Cipher Text

1.	Create a text file that is at least 1000 bytes long.

2.	Encrypt the file using the AES-128 cipher.
```bash
openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -e -in longfile.txt -out ecb_enc -K 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
# only ECB doesn't need -iv
# repeat the process for different modes
```

3.	**A single bit of the 55th byte in the encrypted file got corrupted.** You can achieve this corruption using the hex editor `bless filename`.

4.	Decrypt the corrupted ciphertext file using the correct key and IV (SAME KEY).
```bash
openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -d -in ecb_enc -out ecb_dec -K 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
```

- How much information can you recover by decrypting the corrupted file, if the encryption mode is `ECB`, `CBC`, `CFB`, or `OFB`?
