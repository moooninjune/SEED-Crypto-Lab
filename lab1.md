# Lab 1: Secret-Key Encryption Lab

## Task 1: Frequency Analysis:
Given a ciphertext encrypted using a **monoalphabetic substitution cipher** (each letter in the original text is replaced by another letter, where the replacement does not vary), find the original text using frequency analysis:
  1. Using the provided 'freq.py' program, youâ€™ll find the letters statistics.
  2. Make use of these: [Letters frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis), [Bigram frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram), [Trigram frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram).
