# Lab 2: MD5 Collision Attack Lab

## Task 1: Generating Two Different Files with the Same MD5 Hash:
> **Hashing** is about taking any input (like a file or message) and converting it into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value.
> Used to ensure that data has not been altered during transmission. When the data is received or retrieved, the hash value is recalculated and compared to the original hash. If they match, the data is intact; if not, it has been altered.

**A secure one-way hash function must satisfy two key properties:**
   1. **One-way property:**
   
      Given a hash value (h), it should be extremely difficult to find the original input (M) such that `hash(M) = h`.
   2. **Collision-resistance property:**
   
      It should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs (M1 and M2) that result in the same hash value `(hash(M1) = hash(M2))`.
      

> **MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5)** is a hashing algorithm that takes an **input** in blocks of `512 bits (or 64 bytes)` and produces an **output**: `128-bit hash value`. It’s unsuitable for secure applications; better alternative is *SHA-256*.

```bash
echo "Make any prefix file you want" > prefix.txt

md5collgen -p prefix.txt -o out1.bin out2.bin

diff out1.bin out2.bin
# they should differ

md5sum out1.bin
md5sum out2.bin
# they should have the same hash value even though they differ in content
```
