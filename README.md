# SEED-Crypto-Lab

- This explanation was written by me, for myself. I'm not a professional, just a student trying to learn more about cryptography. I wanted to share it in case anyone else finds it helpful. If you notice any mistakes, I hope you'll understand! :)

- Each lab has its own folder, where you'll find different tasks, with explanations, code, and outputs. If you're exploring, I hope these materials help you in your learning journey too!

- Check out [SEED Project Labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/) for more information!
